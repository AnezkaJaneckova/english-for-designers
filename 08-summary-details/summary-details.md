# BREWERY MALÝ JANEK IN JINCE #
My bachelor's thesis is about rebranding the existing brand for a gastro client who is Malý Janek (Small Janek) brewery in Jince.
Firstly I will describe our history of the brand Malý Janek and  Where it all journey began. 

In 2016, (When I was a first grande at High School) when my father saw a restaurant (before a Greek restaurant) for rent in Prague. And he got an idea. Founded a new business. Brasserie. When you found 20 beer specials from Czech breweries for example Malěšov, Muflon z Kunratic, Matuška, Cvikov... and Czech and pub cuisine. Also, I went to help with some work. For example, I Washed the dishes, spread food,  poured a beer and also designed a Daily menu or something else. Some posters for the event. 

After years, when my dad wanted to brew an own beer. So he founded a beer brand, Létající pivovar Malý Janek. A gipsy brewery. It means when you have your beer brand which you own and you don't have an own brewery, where the beer would be made. 
Gypsy, or nomad, brewing usually falls under the category of contract brewing. Gipsy breweries generally do not have their equipment or premises. They operate on a temporary or itinerant basis out of the facilities of another brewery, generally making "one-off" special occasion beers. Our beer was started to be produced and supplied to us by the Cvikov brewery.

In the year 2019, my dad bought a brewery Vilém from Jince. And he started work at this brewery. and he founded the brand Malý Janek brewery from Jinec. And in March 2020 the brewery opened like Malý Janek brewery from Jinec.
