###### Case study
# CARS ARE EVERYWHERE AND THEREâ€™S A LOT OF THEM!

The project started when I was doing homework to typography at school. We had to do a poster about information graphic, in the isotype style. 

#### What is ISOTYPE? What does it mean?
Isotype (International System of Typographic Picture Education) is a method of showing social, technological, biological, and historical connections in pictorial form. It consists of a set of standardized and abstracted pictorial symbols to represent social-scientific data with specific guidelines on how to combine identical figures using serial repetition. Professional definition. 

Simply, it is a pictorial language that everyone understands, no matter where we come from or what we do.
