# ABOUT MYSELF  :)

### Hi, My name is Anežka 
(It is a very traditional Czech name.) I live in Prague, the capital city of the Czech Republic.
In English it is Agnes, but I prefer Ann or Annie. 

I’m  a creative designer who is interested in photography, graphic design, typography, and a little bit of advertising and marketing. 

I enjoy designing visual identities, logos, posters, animated GIFs, and I’m not afraid to learn new things, actually I prefer new challenges.

I’m a dog lover, food lover, beer lover, and car lover. 
Also, I enjoy playing golf, movies, sewing, drawing, painting, and traveling with my boyfriend and dog.

And of course, learning new skills of graphic design and meet interesting new things. :)
